 * This is a wrapper around react-beautiful-dnd's Droppable component.
 * It is designed to fix a known issue where the library is not compatible
 * with React 18's Strict Mode, which is enabled in Next.js development.
 * Strict Mode's double-rendering behavior corrupts the internal state of the
 * library, causing an "Invariant failed: isDropDisabled must be a boolean" error.
 * 
 * This wrapper ensures that the Droppable component is only rendered on the
 * client, after the initial mount, thus bypassing the double-render issue.
